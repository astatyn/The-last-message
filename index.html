  <p>Yaad hai I used to say ki dekh lena ek din hum nahi honge , sch me khtm hojayenge , and u used to take it as a joke , and aaj when u r reading this.... Irony dekho I'm 6 feets below the ground . Ab chahte toh is last message ko bhi Boht ache se poetry ki trah likh skte the , prr shayad usme bhi mere  references smjh nahi paati tm . 

Well I really want to thank u for all u did for me . For giving me so much mental support jb bikul mere andar kisi chiz ki himmat nahi thi  , for being the only person who trusted me and my potential when nobody else did . For being my bestfriend, my dearest person when I needed u so much . Jb bilkul jeene ki wjah nahi thi na yrr mere paas , tmne hope di thi jeene ki , jb Boht jyada bure phase me the tb tmne yakeen dilaya tha ki avi bhi sbkuch achieve kr skte hai hum . Jb jeena nahi chahte the na sirf tmko dekhkr tmhare waade ke liye jee gaye the . Will always be thankful for what u did for me . 

Prr kaash wo saath , wo meri bestfriend hamesha mere saath rehti . Prr jb se tm gaya aayi thi , I lost my bestfriend, bilkul available nahi thi tm mere liye . U stopped caring for me , u stopped giving a f about me . Hum toh yaad bhi nahi hote the tmko , tmhari is duniya me meri koi jagah nahi thi , kaam nahi hota tha hmse toh hmko text bhi nahi krti thi ab . I was going through all this shit alone prr u did no longer care to help me with it . Kyuki ab ye hamari problem thodi , ab ye bs meri problem thi .  Upar se apne behaviour se u just added it to my misery . Kisi aur ke behaviour ko insaan ignore kr bhi de , but my dearest person, seriously. Within a span of a month u broke all your promises that we vowed each other over all these years . 
Since I came here , I was in so much pain , jo ldki hmko binaa bole smjh jaati thi , wo ab bolne pr bhi smjhne ki kosish nahi kr rhi thi , ulta ab tmko ye dikkat tha ki tmko apni problem kyu bta rhe hai hum . Kitni aasani se boldia tha na tmne ki hum nahi sun rahe toh naye log bnao na , yrr the person jo mere accident ke pehle waale self ko jaanta hai , the person who used to call me dearest, wo nahi smjhna chahta hmko toh koi aur kyu smjhna chahega . I had so many problems, but u didn't care , I tried to communicate, since the last 20 nights I kept crying, but instead of listening u decided to leave me in tears . Tmhare efforts itne mehenge hogye the ki u decided to keep your efforts and let me go . Busy toh ghanta nahi thi tm , bs Meri koi importance , koi value nahi bachi thi tmhare life me ab .
Itne pain me the firbhi  , Boht forgive kiye , Boht kosish kiye to keep living and crying through all this pain ki tm wpis pehle jaisa treat krne lagegi hmko and everything will be fine. But I've had enough. Is bekar ki hope se bs hum aur mera trust hi toot'ta rha . 
Ab itne promises tm break kr hi chuki thi toh hum soche ki ek promise hmbhi break kr hi dete hai fir . 
And ab dekho where we are ...... Sirf 1100 kms ka faasla nahi hai ab , but I'm 6 ft under the ground. And ab kitni bhi kosish krlo kitna bhi regret krlo , u won't ever be able to reach me . Boht gussa hojati thi na tm mere aisa bolne pe , ab ky ? Ab kya karegi gussa hokr . 

Ab jo I'm no longer there let me tell u something. The poetry that I wrote for u , that I sent on your birthday, every word of that poetry was true , seriously u meant so much to me . I loved u so much , more than I've ever loved anyone, may it be anytime , even when I was with someone or whatever.
Never loved you just for your looks or  , makeup filter lgakr koi bhi ldki thik thak dikh legi yer , prr tmhari personality ko na chahna impossible tha bilkul . But that doesn't mean ki I broke your trust or something I didn't want to date u coz aditi yrt we were more than that u know that Insb chizon se jyada upar hua krta tha hamara rishta , the thing that we used to call each other , "Dearest person" , Yrr param mitr thi tm meri , Irreplaceable till the end of my life . As I used to say ki hamare rishte ke saath hmbhi khtm ho jayenge , and aaj dekho here we are ......! Kbhi bhi khudko lekr insecure mt hona yrr , just remember ki whatever I said in that poetry every word was true . And trust me the person you'll marry he'll be the luckiest person not just on this plannet , but in all the timelines that'll exist. This is what I know , what I always believed. 
I knew ki I can't ever be that person isliye I never tried , aisa nahi ki confident nahi the prr meri kishmat kitni  meherbaan hai pta tha hmko , and accident ke baad toh koi chance banta hi nahi tha .
Unfortunately I can't even attend your wedding now , but make sure ki ye haq kisi sahi insaan ko mile , who cares for u , jitne efforts hum daalte the atleast wo 80% daale .

And aisa mt sochna ki tmhare liye apne andar koi hate lekr jarhe hai , Boht saari achi memories bhi hai . Shayad se mere aakhri  7 minute bhi tmhare hawaale honge . Infact right now hamari jo saath me pic thi , that's my wallpaper, coz that was the last time I smiled . Had it on my wallpaper since I came here . Aur haan don't worry I'll try to make sure ki saare suboot Mita kr jaaye , so that u don't land in a problem coz of me . Coz sch me yrr tmhari glti thodi hai .... Accident ke baad abtk jee gye ye bhi toh aapki meherbaani thi na , aapki di hui zindagi thi . Ab hum agr ye sockr aage jeene ka dicide kie ki aage bhi tm saath rhegi toh meri glti hai na ....  .   Tmhare saare ehsaano ke liye shukriya. And I don't know ki khudko kbhi maaf kr bhi payegi ya nahi , but I've already forgiven u .  Mere saare gifts smbhaal kr rkhna , aur ironically tmhare is saal ke birthday ka gift tmko 26th ke around deliver hoga shayad , wo le lena . Aur Boht avoid krti thi na tm mere texts ka reply dena , well I've made a compilation of all the unread texts and poetries , I'll try ki wo bhi tmko mil jaaye , so that jb bhi tmko meri yaad aaye thoda aur regret bhi ho . 
And remember the line that I said to u on the day of my accident, I want to say the same today  ...." Just remember ki I always just wanted u to be successful". Well do it for me , shaukh toh Boht the ki duniya Jeetni thi tmhare saath , prr ab tmko tmhari ye nayi duniya mubaarak . And our stupid promise ki "saath me jahannam chlenge" , it breaks here with all other promises, tmko tmhari duniya mubaarak , hum chle akele . And I wish ki after u achieve everything tb bhi uske baad tmko yaad aayegi meri , u won't get a true friend like me  . Coz I don't even need to curse u for that , duniya kitni selfish hai ye khud smjh aajayega tmko . And I wish ki mere hisse ki success jo hum chorr ja rhe hai , wo bhi tmko mile . Well that's all I wanna say . Hope that I was a  good friend .

Alvida hamesha ke liye .
